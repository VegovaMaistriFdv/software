        <p>We are a team from Electrotechnical and Computer Technical Engineering and Gymnasium Ljubljana, located in the heart of Slovenia. Our team members, Alja, Nejc, Jakob, Matic, and Ema, are all or were in the past enrolled in the written school, searching for answers in all fields we could reach. Those include astronomy, electricity, computer science, art and others.
    
            We are five curious individuals, excited to be part of something bigger.</p>
